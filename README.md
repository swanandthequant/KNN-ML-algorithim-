# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Project  

This project applies the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm for both regression and classification problems.  
The goal was to understand how KNN works and how predictions are made based on nearest data points.  

---

## Dataset  
- I created the dataset myself using **sklearn.datasets**.  
- Since the dataset was generated in the file, no special data cleaning was needed.  

---

## Methodology  

### Regression Problem Statement  
1. Model Training (KNN Regressor used, no cleaning step required).  
2. Model Evaluation with:  
   - r2_score  
   - mean_absolute_error  
   - mean_squared_error  

### Classifiaction Problem Statement  
1. Model Training (KNN Classifier applied directly).  
2. Model Evaluation with:  
   - accuracy_score  
   - confusion_matrix  
   - classification_report  

---

## What I Learned  
- How the KNN ML algo is derived and why it works.  
- How to train models based on distance to nearest neighbors.  
- Difference between KNN for regression vs classification.
