## datasets
I made the dataset Myself using SKlearn.Dataset

## Methodolody
1. Model Training(I just made this dataset inside the file so no Data CLeaning was Needed and I used KNN ML algo)
2. Model Evaluation (using r2_score,mean_absolute_error,mean_squared_error)

This was for Regression Problem statement
Classifiaction
1. Model Training(I just made this dataset inside the file so no Data CLeaning was Needed and I used KNN ML algo)
2. Model Evaluation (using accuracy_score,confusion_matrix,classification_report)


## what I learned
I learned about How the KNN ML algo is derived How can we Train our model Base on this

Thank you everyone
